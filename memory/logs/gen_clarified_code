The data you're working with is a 20k Mixture of NSCLC DTCs from 7 donors, and the dataset source is provided.\n\nThe R script involves multiple steps including:\n\nLoading libraries and the NSCLC dataset.\nInitializing the Seurat object with the raw (non-normalized data).\nPerforming Quality Control (QC).\nFiltering the data.\nNormalizing the data.\nIdentifying highly variable features.\nScaling the data.\nPerforming Linear dimensionality reduction.\nClustering the data.\nPerforming non-linear dimensionality reduction.\nThe script is currently working well in an R environment. Now, you'd like to transition this workflow to a web-based environment.
